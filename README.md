## Introduction

In this project, I have worked with the Iris Flowers dataset, which is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. The goal is to build a machine-learning model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their features.

## Dataset

The Iris Flowers dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. For each sample, four features were measured: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is included in many machine-learning libraries, making it easily accessible for educational purposes.


## Model Evaluation and Results

Here are the evaluation scores for different machine-learning models on the Iris Flowers dataset:

| Score | Model                  |
|-------|------------------------|
| 0.947 | Logistic Regression   |
| 0.947 | Support Vector Machines|
| 0.947 | Naive Bayes           |
| 0.947 | KNN                    |
| 0.921 | Decision Tree          |

Among these models, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes achieved the highest score of 0.947. These models appear to be well-suited for the classification task on the Iris Flowers dataset.
